Awesome! Let's create a brag document to showcase your accomplishments over the past year. I'll ask you a series of questions to help capture the details we need:

General Overview:
What are your primary roles and responsibilities in your current position?

I am the product manager for Sentry's SDKs. In truth there are too many SDKs for me to really be involved and impactful everywhere.
JavaScript takes up a lot of my time. Followed by Python. After that I rely on the engineers for each SDK to maintain their SDKs and platforms. 
While also relying that the SDK engineers surface questions on priority and opportunities they see.

- I am responsible to help ensure the teams are working towards company initiatives.
- Go To Market documents: i maintain a standardized system for tracking the release and marketing efforts for SDK works
-- this helps form a contract with the engineers, and gives a single point of reference for marketing counterparts
- I help to keep track of data points, and generally be a source of data to help make data driven decisions.
-- i strive to have some level of data driven insights on the ecosystem, from different reports and internal data. But attending conferences as well helps keeo my insights huma
-- as well as customer calls 
-- and my own time spent dogfooding, to help develop my own intuition
- I keep SDK work connected with other parts of the org, especially playing a crucial role with marketing and sales.
- I ensure that when the team works on new features, that when there is something which can be marketable that I help turn that into content. 
Whether that means that i write blog posts, changelogs,request artwork, or help encourage engineers to do it themselves. I play a driving role. Especailly now that there is no 
dedicated product marketing manaager for SDKs.
- I work with mgmt and others (milin, gautham, rahul, and others) to help build integrations with partners companies.
-- Supabase, Twilio, Turso
-- sometimes that means i am very hands on in guiding the partner, sometimes i merely a marekting voice. In some cases like twilio it was purlely
driven by me and contacts of mine at twilio
- I monitor inbound streams which are not already triaged by the SDK teams, like social, reddit, stack overflow and user feedbacl. 
I triage this by responing when I can, inviting users to a call or to give more feedback, or routing the content to the correct persons.
- I work with sales to monitor customer cases and push them forward. Sometimes it is just to get more information from SEs, others i could work with the 
customers directly to help mitigate concerns, or work with teams to prio engineering efforts if need be.
-- example with Shopify orgs using Hydrogen or pushing for prio on Web Vitals.
- I use Sentry. I setup SDKs, and use different products. Testing and documenting feedback to the team.
-- i also do this in a data driven manner, "can we improve onboarding? Can we measure it?""

Did you have any major goals for the past year? What were they?
- there are goals for the teams but not really for me. This is maybe problematic.
- Things like helping to push Vue or source maps adoptions are not really my goals.
- I want to help the teams to be successful, that can be linked to team goals, but it is not the same.

Projects and Accomplishments:
Can you list some key projects you worked on this year? What were your roles in each?
- V8: work with team on decisions and prios around the release
-- up until the last day when i voiced concerns around the onbaording with OTel which was continued int he ESM work later in the year
-- coordinating all the marketing efforts which included a blog post and getting all the designs to be used in for pages and changelogs
- Nuxt, branching out to ESM more generically
-- helping to forget relationships with Nuxt and Vue ecosystem folks, to simplify amplifying our release
-- honestly i have just continued to complain and nag that i hate the import model, and pushed about the topic with Netlify and Vercel,
and it may sound dumb but I think getting this helped get to a better solution.
- DebugIDs moving forward:
-- again i just kept bringing it up, and eventually in the JS team offsite we agreed with Abhi to work on it with Tim. Since then it has finally
gotten wheels, and i am excited to see what Tim, Abhi, and Luca are doing there
- Supabase Integration: blog for reference https://blog.sentry.io/monitor-supabase-databases-and-edge-functions/
-- this included content ont he supabase site as well
- Twilio Integration: blog for reference https://blog.sentry.io/monitoring-twilios-flex-agent-desktop-with-sentry/ 
- Turso Integration: changelog for reference https://sentry.io/changelog/turso--sentry-trace-slow-queries-and-capture-sqlite-errors/
-- this was a lot of coordination with their devrel to get the integration delivered, and then with out marketing and design team to get content
on our static sites and changelogs
-- as well content on their site https://turso.tech/blog/trace-slow-queries-and-capture-sqlite-errors-with-sentry
- Attempt to help get more content on framework websites
-- Astro
-- there is a GH issue somewhere with more

- Suport interns 
-- this isn't 100% my job, but for the 2 interns we had i intuited that Elias especially needed support and I stepped in to help him. Provided data
a GTM plan and ideas for what he could work on and importantly what "success" looked like for him. Data points and how he could pitch it. Metrics died in the water,
but that is another topic.
-- Nico worked on Nest which i also developed a plan for him, and provided ideas based on data what kind improvements would help him and our users
-- specically looking at data around Nest NPM downloads and NEst sentry project creation, then looking at the transaction origins there and other paltforms to think
how he could find ways to add more value with more nuances txn from different origins

all of these GTM docs can be found here by the way: https://www.notion.so/sentry/793c0894f8af467884a6dfac903b9d94?v=2d83d6757e444f14a4511b297a7451c7

- Marketing redo of static sites for pages
-- i am a main source of contact for helping the marketing colleagues decide on content and style for pages in the new static sites
-- example worked with abhi to outline what are differentiatiors we have across all JS SDKs, and specifically next, react, vue and others
-- this applies to backend as well of course
-- doc for refernce

What specific contributions did you make to these projects? For example, did you lead, design, or implement any critical parts?
- I elaborated on that above, hopefully you can decypher that

Can you quantify the impact of your work on any project? (E.g., improvements in performance, cost savings, user engagement, etc.)
- that is difficult to do
0


Were there any features you shipped or products you launched? If so, what impact did they have?
Collaboration and Mentorship:
Did you mentor or support any colleagues or new hires? If so, in what capacity?
maybe move the content from Nico and Elias to here
also the mention of nagging, i nag about ESM with Sigrid and Andrei, and I am really excited with the solution they have
as well to coach them to reach out to these maintainers directly, and that we can work with them to develop AND promote 

Were there any significant collaborative efforts where your input was crucial (e.g., reviews, cross-team initiatives)?
Come back to me on this one

Process Improvements and Non-Technical Contributions:

Did you improve any processes, create documentation, or make other non-technical contributions that benefited your team?
- GTM doc evolved to help with work with teams and PMM, since there are so many things going on. It helps me a ton. And did help PMM before they left

Have you worked on any tasks related to company culture, such as recruitment, onboarding, or fostering team cohesion?
- honestly it's not my job, but i do help with the office atmospher whether that is official or not, i do. I organzie padel with colleages regularly, started a lil
run club, and also try to be active with the team and uplifting way. It is not unintentional from my side to try and be "fun" and engaging.

Professional Development:
What new skills did you learn or improve upon this year? How did they benefit your role?
- Definetley upscaled fast with AI tools liek chatgpt and cursor
- processes like with the GTM docs are good
- generally organize the chaose and try to push forward all the topcis

Did you give any talks, participate in panels, or engage with the community in a way that contributed to your growth?
- It is a stretch but i did a live seminar with Abhi: content for reference https://sentry.io/resources/fix-your-front-end-javascript-edition/
- I have attended 3 or 4 conferences, i forget now

Goals and Impact Reflection:
Reflecting on this year, which work are you most proud of? Why?
- I enjoy getting the content out the door, 
- i am happy to help push the team on quality
- i have been happy to dogfood more and more to help drive the quality of the above two

Is there any area you feel you excelled at more than expected?
- i think i have been able to help push the team on quality

Are there themes or patterns you noticed in your work? Did any of these reveal growth opportunities or areas you wish to explore further?
- Again to be honest SDK PM role is ambiguous and stretched
- i am not sure it is the best application of myself at sentry
- yes i believe i give value to the team, and sentry but i do wonder if i could do more if i was more "targeted"
- even doing this document i realize a handful of things that were just sidequests, which is fun too!
