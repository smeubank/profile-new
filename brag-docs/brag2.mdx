## Process Improvements and Non-Technical Contributions
- Evolved the GTM documentation to improve workflow and coordination with marketing and other teams.
- Enhanced office culture through informal team-building initiatives (padel, running, and i am generaly active postive force inthe office).
 - i would include relationship building at envets in SF for example, even got a run club goin there :D 

## Professional Development
- Rapid adoption of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Cursor) to work more efficiently and become more hands on with devtools
- I use a wide range of devtools to dogfood not just sentry and not just competitor products
 - i also started a process in the PM team that we are reandomly paired document our learning from different products
 - Docs here [Competitor Product Donut Dives](https://www.notion.so/sentry/Competitor-Product-Donut-Dives-3ce6349105a042b79ad16dd1096053f9)
 - this also helps with team building with PM form Sentry and CodeCov
 - as my docs on dogfooding have now also branched out to include CodeCov and I aligne with Eli, AJ, and Rohit on my findings
 and importantly what i think they could do to improve and measure it, based on our experiences with Sentry
 - Nuxt and Vue [notion docs](https://www.notion.so/sentry/70bb8caf18204f02adeb204485e49f73?v=c58014ff2b3a4b4886b83694af5df85a) have the most content and include the codeccov tests
- Continued development and refinement of process-driven approaches (e.g., GTM docs).
- Attended multiple conferences to work booth mainly
